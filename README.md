# About the project
This project predict the trend of Covid-19 pandemic using ***Linear Regression*** and ***Polynomial Regression***. The programming language used is Python.
# About the dataset
We use the dataset collected by Our World In Data (OWID). The dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data).
# Implementation progress
The analysing progress consists of 4 steps:
- **Step 1**: *Data collecting*. This step includes importing data, cleaning data and sampling data.
- **Step 2**: *Data analysis*, plotting and analysing data.
- **Step 3**: *Build the prediction model*, using built-in functions from `sklearn`.
- **Step 4**: *Model analysis*.

Full implementation can be found at this [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xHzaPjP_sCVKU0z6Np3CagS2CC50I8bA) and this [report]()
